# Swaram (స్వరం)

A music manager to go along with spotDL. Still a work in progress.

# Developer QuickStart

The backend has been completed. You can see relevant "quick-start" docs by generating the entire
documentation with `dart doc` and looking at the library level documentation.

You can get a quick overview of the major issues and their interrelations by taking a look at
our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/spotDL/projects/7).

## Other notes

- You can look at more detailed API docs by generating the documentation using `dartdoc`. Further
developer notes in the source code.

- File naming conventions:

    - `.model.dart`: Files that compose the data model for the app.

    - `.ui.dart`: UI components. The main navigation routing pages are to be stored under
    `./lib/ui`, the custom components used for those pages are under `./lib/ui/components`. These
    files will not be documented.

    - `.util.dart`: Generic helper/ease-of-life functions.
